(1)  What are the new tags added in HTML5 ?
Ans: Short Answer: Well, you have a good bunch of new, handy markup tags in HTML5.

Long Answer: New in HTML 5—

1) The doctype: You need not to write down a long and messy doctype tag. Just type <!DOCTYPE html> and you are good to go.
2) The charset: You write <meta charset="UTF-8"> to define the character set of your document. No need to add http-equiv or text/html anymore.
3) Structural Tags: You now have <section>, <header>, <main>, <footer>, <nav>, <menu>, <article>, <aside>, <figure> to structure your markup well. Rather than using a div, consider any one of these elements depending on their nature and your need.
4) Form fields: You have way more options than just the text or password. Listing date, datetime, datetime-local, month, week, time, number, range, email, url, search; you can do more with the forms with HTML5.
5) Media Elements: You now have <audio> and <video> tags to embed rich media without having to write a messy code. Both make use of <source> tag within.
6) Canvas: <canvas> allows you to add a canvas-like space to webpages; handy to pull dynamic graphs with JavaScript. You can bring it one step further by adding a JavaScript-driven game.
7) Data-marking: <command>, <datalist>, <keygen>, <mark>, <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <time> tags mark the data according to the nature.
Context-menus: Add and control context-menus on your webpages. More here.
Asynchronous Scripts: You have an additional attribute (async) for the script tag, that tells the browser to load that script asynchronously; i.e. load scripts in parallel, without blocking the page rendering. Also, you don’t have to add “text/javascript” every time you embed a JavaScript, writing just <script> will do.

(2)  How to embed audio and video in a webpages ?
Ans:  You have audio and video tags that allow you to add audio and video directly to your pages.
If you want to insert content from YouTube you can copy their embed code or create the embed programmatically.
Other media hosting providers also give you the embed code they’d like you to use, you’ll have to find it in their user interfaces

(3)  Semantic element in HTML5 ?
Ans: HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed.
Where the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer.
Because the web was not initially built to be designed, programmers used different hacks to get things laid out in different ways. Rather than using the <table></table> to describe information using a table, programmers would use them to position other elements on a page.
As the use of visually designed layouts progressed, programmers started to use a generic “non-semantic” tag like <div>. They would often give these elements a class or id attribute to describe their purpose. For example, instead of <header> this was often written as <div class="header">.
As HTML5 is still relatively new, this use of non-semantic elements is still very common on websites today. 

(4)  Canvas and SVG tags ?
Ans: SVG:- 1)SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution
2) SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.
3) SVG can be modified through script and CSS
4) SVG is vector based and composed of shapes.

CANVAS:-1) Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution
2) Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
3) Canvas can be modified through script only.
4) Canvas is raster based and composed of pixel.
